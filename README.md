# 🔐 Data Encryption & Decryption Program

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **React Native** application that allows users to **encrypt and decrypt** text using a **custom encryption algorithm** with a **secret key**. The app provides a simple UI to enter text, encrypt it, and decrypt it back.

The source code is also available as a **GitHub Gist** for public collaboration and reuse.

## ✨ Features

-   🔑 **Custom Encryption Algorithm**
-   🔓 **Secure Decryption using a Secret Key**
-   🔄 **Case-Sensitive Data Handling**
-   📂 **Modular and Reusable Code**
-   📱 **Cross-Platform (iOS & Android) Support**
-   🎨 **Simple & Interactive UI**
-   🌐 **Links to HNG & GitHub Repository**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📂 Cloning the Repository

To use this program locally, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KING-REX/HNG-Mobile-Stage-1.git
cd HNG-Mobile-Stage-1
```

### 🛠 Installation & Setup

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **Expo CLI** installed:

1. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```sh
    npx expo start
    ```

3. Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app or run it on a simulator.

## 🔑 How It Works

### **Encryption Process**

1. User enters text and a secret key.
2. The app encrypts the text using a **custom algorithm**.
3. The encrypted text is displayed in the app.

### **Decryption Process**

1. User enters the **encrypted text** and the same **secret key**.
2. The app decrypts the text back to its original state.
3. The decrypted text is displayed in the app.
